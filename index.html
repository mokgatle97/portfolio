            <h3>Hi, my name is Lefa Mokgatle</h3>
                <p>I am 24 years of age and grew up in Johannesburg, South Africa. I graduated from AFDA in 2019 for a Bcom degree in Business Innovation and Technology. The different technologies we were exposed taught me and showed me the real need Africa has programmers and drivers of innovation. Which is how I decided to take the deep dive in learning Javascript and fortunately enough while learning managed to get into the amazin Umuzi programme which will definetly shape me into a great programmer.</p>
